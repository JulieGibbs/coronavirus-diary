# Coronavirus Diary
_Ethically sourcing data for the fight against disease._

Coronavirus Diary is a mobile application that allows users to record their medical status, location, and activities to an encrypted vault on their device. If the user experiences symptoms in line with the disease, they will be prompted to contact their physician.

In the case that a user contracts the disease, they can release their historical data to a physician to aid in treatment, research, and containment effort.
