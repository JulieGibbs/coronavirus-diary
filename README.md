Coronavirus Diary is a mobile application that allows users to view local COVID-19 statistics, anonymously submit their symptoms, and aid in the COV-SARS-2 response efforts. The submitted data will enable both medical and political authorities to coordinate a well-informed response to the outbreak and predict upcoming spikes in infections.
