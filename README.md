# Coronavirus Diary
_Ethically sourcing data for the fight against disease._

Coronavirus Diary is a mobile application that allows users to store data about their location and social activity in an encrypted vault on their device. In the case that a user contracts an infectious disease, they can release this data to a medical provider to aid in the disease containment effort.
