# Thanks for offering to help out!

Since the US has been short on test kits, we are trying to figure out how many people have symptoms that could be due to COVID-19. The information gathered from this website will help predict where hospitals will be under the most strain. Hopefully doctors and supplies can be sent to the right places.

You are anonymous. We don’t want to know who you are! We will ask for your zip code to count cases around specific hospitals. Your symptom severity will be used to guess how likely it is that you have COVID-19, and to see how many people in your region are getting severely sick.

Total daily cases for zip codes will be provided to state and local health authorities, the CDC, and the US Government to help predict which communities need the most support. We will also make a map here. Data will also be analyzed for geographic trends. We might see fewer cases in areas that closed schools for a long time, or maybe the epidemic slows down in hot weather.

Since you are anonymous, You will be provided with a browser bookmark that uniquely identifies you. With the bookmark you can come back later and enter new information on a different day. We will know it’s you and won’t count you twice. Maybe you feel a lot worse, or you got a COVID-19 test result and would like to let us know.

We will not sell this data. It will only be used for public health and research and deleted after the epidemic has run its course.

If this is all OK, please click “I agree”. Otherwise click “No!”
